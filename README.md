# linzstrom-consumption

This project aims at automatically getting power consumption information from Linz Strom AG (https://services.linznetz.at/verbrauchsdateninformation).

It uses a headless Chrome to log in and download consumption data as CSV for all appliances.

The data can be directly inserted into an InfluxDb as measurements.
